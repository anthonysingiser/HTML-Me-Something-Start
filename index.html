<!-- Your mission is to build a page that:

    Tells a story. This can be personal or impersonal, funny, serious or neither. You can do whatever you like, but it should be something in the range of 3-10 paragraphs or sections. Here is an example , and here are some other ideas:
        Create a résumé page that tells the story of your professional journey to-date, and where you want to go as a coder.
        Describe a trip you took.
        Talk about one of your hobbies or passions.

            <header>
            <footer>
            <main>
            <article>.

        If you need to review any of these tags, check out the HTML tag reference at w3schools.

        Uses at least one <img> tag (hopefully more).
            When placing images in your page, put them in a new subfolder called images within your html-me-something directory.

        Uses at least one HTML entity .

        Hint: putting a copyright notice in your footer will afford you the opportunity to use &copy;, but you should also try to get creative here.

         <h2>Guitars Are Sick</h2>
         <img src="./images/Coolest-Looking-Guitar-Six-Neck.jpg" width="400">
         <p>There are so many kinds of guitars, and a lot of them are super cool looking and make it real easy to shred on, except for bass guitars, bass guitars are LAME and are not easy to shred on, the strings are TOO THICK. But regular guitars are sick.

         <img src="./images/squier.jpeg" width="400">
         <p>My first guitar was a Fender Squier, and it was the coolest thing I had ever seen. I was 14 years old and I thought I was the coolest kid in school. I was not, but I thought I was.

         <h2>My Favorite Guitar To Look At</h2>
         <img src="./images/slashGibson.jpg" width="400">
         <p>My favorite guitar to look at is a Gibson Les Paul. It's a classic, and it's the guitar that Slash from Guns N' Roses plays. I love it so much, I have a poster of it on my wall. I stare at the poster for hours on end, thinking about all the ways one can shred, what lessons from shredding I can apply to my life, and how one person can shred so hard that they can change the world. I think about that a lot.

         <h2>My Dream Guitar</h2>
         <img src="./images/billAndTed.jpg" width="400">
         <p>My dream guitar is a Steinberger. They're super weird looking, and they're made out of carbon fiber. This guitar has no head, it's like the headless horseman of guitars, but it's not spooky, it's just fun to play. It's the guitar that Bill and Ted play at the end of the movie Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure. They're also super expensive, so I'll probably never own one, but I can dream.
